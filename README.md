Julia code developed for the dissertation titled "Gene-Expression Time Delays in Reaction Diffusion Systems"

Numerical simulations for stiff Reaction-Diffusion systems, with Schnakenberg or Gierer-Meinhardt kinetics, can be run from the main.jl file. The script allows
incorporation of gene-expression time delays, in the form of a fixed delay, or distributed delay. Distributions considered include the skew and symmetric truncated 
Gaussian pdfs.
